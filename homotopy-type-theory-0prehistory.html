            <p class="center"><em>This series of posts documents my attempt to understand Univalent foundations
and Homotopy Type Theory. In this one I present the motivations of <span class="caps">V.A.</span>Voevodsky
for introducing the Univalent&nbsp;Foundations.</em></p>
<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins">story</a> begins with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001870886900812">this paper</a> by Spencer
Bloch. It is one of the founding stones in the area of motivic cohomology, but
unfortunately a fundamental result was shown to be false by <span class="caps">A.A.</span> Suslin, shortly
after publication, and there was no alternative proof. So the paper turned into
a collection of conjectures. Only in 1993 a correct proof was&nbsp;published.</p>
<p>In order to progress in this area, <span class="caps">V.A.</span> Voevodsky, <span class="caps">A.A.</span> Suslin and Eric
Friedlander took a different path, which avoided the work of Bloch and relied on
a paper of Voevodsky written in 1992-1993 and published in 1995. While giving a
series of lectures presenting the results in this paper at the <span class="caps">IAS</span> in 2000,
Voevodsky discovered a gap in it. Fortunately he was able to prove a weaker
result and to recover the main results. As a consequence of this fact, he was
shocked that despite many groups of mathematicians studied his paper nobody was
able to spot the mistake, and took his results for&nbsp;granted.</p>
<p>An even scarier chain of events began with the publication of a preprint of
Carlos Simpson, stating that the fundamental result in a paper by Voevodsky and
<span class="caps">M.M.</span> Kapranov is wrong. Simpson was not able to identify the mistake and he only
produced a counter-example. In fact it was not clear if there really was a
mistake in the paper of Kapranov and Voevodsky or one in the example of Simpson.
In 2013 Voevodsky finally came to the conclusion that indeed there is a mistake
in their paper, but as this <a class="reference external" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/234492/what-is-the-mistake-in-the-proof-of-the-homotopy-hypothesis-by-kapranov-and-voev">question</a>
shows it is not easy to understand what precisely is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>This state of affairs in which significant mistakes in important and rather
widely read (at least by the standards of mathematics) went undetected for
decades was a shock to Voevodsky who began thinking about how to correct
this. The obvious solution was to use computers to check the&nbsp;proofs.</p>
<p>At this time (some twenty years ago) there was very little interest of &#8220;real&#8221;
mathematicians for computer proof-assistants. They were used mostly by computer
scientists for formal verification of software and hardware. A more serious
problem was find a new foundation of mathematics as the classical
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice was not appropriate
for Voevodsky&#8217;s needs and also do not play very well with various attempts of
formalization in a computer-friendly&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, which
was developed in the same time with the <a class="reference external" href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a> proof
assistant. Coq is rather well known among computer scientists as the language
used in the <a class="reference external" href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">Software Foundations</a>
course and as the basis of the book <a class="reference external" href="http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/cpdt.pdf">Certified Programming with Dependent Types</a>
by Adam Chlipala. Voevodsky chose this framework for his work on building a new
foundational system for mathematics which he called <strong>univalent foundations</strong>.</p>
<p>The Calculus of Inductive Constructions is a form a <strong>type theory</strong> more
precisely a form of inductive type theory, a foundational system alternative to
set theory. Type theory will be the object of the next&nbsp;post.</p>
